# GDoc-To-Ics

GDocToIcs is an easy to use, high speed Google Docs Spreadsheets to Ics Converter. It turns your spreadsheets in subscribeable calendar feeds!

## Origin Story

On the 5th of November 2022, [@Lobelia_Erinea](https://twitter.com/Lobelia_Erinea) from the german vtuber community on twitter started to collect all vtuber birthdays in a google spreadsheet. I was amazed and thankful for the idea, but instantly thought "I will never be able to open this every day, I am already bad at keeping dates". To organize my life, I had build a few syncable virtual calendar services, but I was way too lazy to create calendar events for the whole spreadsheet. So I kept this thought in my mind for some time, and suddenly remembered that there was a way to share calendar data as an ICal/Ics file and that some people (e.g. my university) used this, to create subcribeable online calendars, that are easy to integrate in your existing setup. As I was looking forward to learn some more go, this seemed like a good side project. Now, here it is. Enjoy!

## Usage

If you have no development or sysadmin experience, I recommend using my hosted service at https://gdoc-to-ics.breuxi.de/.

Currently it is only able to read normal calendars in the format of the one in the "Origin Story" (It also generates twitter url fields, as it expects the calendar events to be twitter usernames. I have not had an idea for an elegant solution for this right now. If you have, ISSUE PLS!), but I will maybe extend it to be much more versatile.

To use it, you simply have to enter the url (e.g. https://gdoc-to-ics.breuxi.de/) followed by "/ical/" and then the ID of the Spreadsheet you want to use in your preferred calendar software. You can also specify a filename (some programs need that to name the calendar) by adding "/\<Your Filename>.ics" and a specific sheet with its id (by default 0, google calls it gid in the url).

For the following examples I will use a "basic" google sheet calendar, containing only the calendar and an entry for the [towel day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day) on 25th may as an example. You can find it at [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iinbiLCiivIYpdDDHftpeYaZZYU7_ItRn8I8u9ZAIWA/](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iinbiLCiivIYpdDDHftpeYaZZYU7_ItRn8I8u9ZAIWA/).

### Basic Example

```
https://gdoc-to-ics.breuxi.de/ical/1iinbiLCiivIYpdDDHftpeYaZZYU7_ItRn8I8u9ZAIWA
```

### Filename Example

```
https://gdoc-to-ics.breuxi.de/ical/1iinbiLCiivIYpdDDHftpeYaZZYU7_ItRn8I8u9ZAIWA/GreatCalendar.ics
```

### Sheet Example

```
https://gdoc-to-ics.breuxi.de/ical/1iinbiLCiivIYpdDDHftpeYaZZYU7_ItRn8I8u9ZAIWA?sheet_id=1965686716
```

These urls can be put into almost all current calendar softwares.
